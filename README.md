Fabric for Ruby

This was an initial attempt to build something similar to Fabric for Ruby. It works, but its not robust or properly error handled.

If you wish to fork it, or put in some Pull Requests, that would be cool.

If you happen to make this into a huge project, all I ask is a small footnote of credit to this original repo.

Look at the example and code to see how its used, its pretty straightforward.
